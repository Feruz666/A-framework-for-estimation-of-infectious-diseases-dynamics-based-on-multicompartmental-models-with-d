Infectious diseases - "a group of diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms, characterized by contagiousness, the presence of an incubation period, the reactions of the infected organism to the pathogen and, as a rule, a cyclical course and the formation of post-infectious immunity.
According to WHO statistics, infectious diseases are the 4th most common cause of death in the world. However, there is a certain correlation between the economic status of the country and the leading cause of death. Thus, in low- income countries 6 deaths out of 10 are caused by infectious diseases, while in high-income countries only upper respiratory tract infections are in the top ten of all infectious diseases, all because the prevention and treatment of such diseases requires significant material costs.
This work focuses on developing a tool to help predict the behavior of a major new infectious disease, the new coronavirus infection COVID-19.
